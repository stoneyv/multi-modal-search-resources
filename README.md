### Multi Modal Search

Resources for incorporating image embeddings, joint image/word embeddings, multi lingual word embeddings for learning to rank or as a replacement for things like BM25 or TFIDF.

* In production retrieve top k documents using SOLR and bm25.  Then rerank the the returned results.
Concatenation of transfer learned image embeddings from a VGG model trained on ImageNet with bag of words
Learning rank from search logs using click and ignore signals

* Great examples of overcoming user labels for Wedding dresses that are not relevant.


2. Ethan Rosenthal (Dia & Co, Birchbox)  
Ethan writes very accessible content and prefers methods that are intuitive.
* He obtained great results from transfer learning on ImageNet VGG model after expending significant effort trying to incorporate side channel information using matrix factorization methods ( WRMF weighted regularized matrix factorization )

* good use case Ikea furniture
* Ikea would have structured data to use as labels for images

6. Aleksander Movchan  
* He assumes that you are already are familiar with "triplet loss functions"
* Triplet loss functions use an anchor, positive example, and a negative example
* You choose anchor, negative example pairs that are more similar to speed up training

Great examples of overcoming disambiguation due to stemming.  
hawk -> some 'Stephen Hawking' along with 'hawk' that is a bird.  
angel -> 'Los Angeles' more than angel

10. Dan Gillick (Google NLP group, instructor at Berkeley)  
Student talk at Berkeley
* learning embeddings in the same vector space for more than one media type
multi lingual search
* Increasing relevancy by returning more results from tail of documents.
* They mostly use Google search logs
